    <h1>User Testing Results</h1>
    <section id="user1">
        <h2>User 1</h2>
        <p>The interactions were great and consistent with the interactions on the page. However the user did want some more context on how the user landed up in the situation that they currently were in. The user also enjoyed the background noise which improved the immersive experience of the site. However the user wanted the submit button to make it more obvious that it was in fact a submit button.</p>

    <section id="user2">
        <h2>User 2</h2>
        <p>The user enjoyed the straightforwardness of the page as well the supporting visuals to the narrative of the MadLibs. However even this user requested for more clarity to the situation that led to the conversation that plays out in the website. Furthermore the user also commented on the awkward shape of the submit button which was confused for a loading animation.</p>

    <section id="user3">
        <h2>User 3</h2>
        <p>The user appreciated the visuals and the typefaces used for the web page. However, the user again was confused with the use of a circular button which looked awfully a lot like a loading icon. The user also suggested removing the uneven breaks in the overlay to display the poem, removing the necessity of scrolling to view the entire poem.</p>

        <h2>Approach to Final Project</h2>
        <p>I will mostly follow through with the common transgressions that the users had with my User Test. I will probably add an interactable overlay as well as a better submit button during form inquiry as well as an indication of how much of the form is remaining. I might also add in small animations to maintain the immersiveness of the webpage as well as context to the situation that I am putting the user in.</p>
