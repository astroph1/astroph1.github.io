    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <p id="summary">Improving my first project to develop a seamless MadLibs experience</p>
    <article id="comp1">
        <h2>Comparison 1 - <a href="https://en.akinator.com/">Akinator</a></h2>
        <p>The website may seem pretty obscure who isn’t familiar with the Akinator website, but is greeted with a simple interface, albeit the download and connect to the Protecto maybe annoying for initial users. The questions may be a bit arbitrary, however
            with the passage of time the questions, the Akinator bot slowly but almost surely gets the person/item/object. </p>
        <p>The questions are all answered in the form of Yes/No/Maybe and doesn’t give the user a lot of creative freedom, but is essential to the thinking process to narrow down to the thought that the user is thinking. The UI is straightforward (excluding
            the annoying ads) and shows only the question, and the result screen is also pretty simple, with the Yes or No buttons to confirm or continue guessing. </p>
        <p>There maybe could be some animations to captivate the audience to play the game more, but mainly the people entering the website want to check the ability of the Akinator bot, so it’s not that necessary, but a welcome improvement.</p>

        <h2>Comparison 2 - <a href="https://en.akinator.com/">MadLibs Website</a></h2>
        <p>The Mad-Libs website is itself a good source of inspiration for the project I have in mind. With its seamless transitions and randomly placed interactables, the website offers a succinct description of the game of Mad-Libs. The multiple colors
            used on the website shows the degree of variations in Mad-Libs, which are uncountable in number. The “scrollability” of the website is also pretty high as the transitions between sections is also pretty smooth. </p>
        <p>There could definitely be a few changes in the overall UX of the page. The navbar has enough space to hold all elements in the menu and the animations can sometimes be a little too overbearing to not just the viewer but also the page (it gets
            slow at times).</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to - </p>
        <ul id="goals">
            <li>implement the ideas on my Mad-Libs that I previously was unable to</li>
            <li>Mainly improve on the “jankiness” of the website </li>
            <li>definitely improve on the styling of the page </li>
            <li>add proper transitions between the prompts of the pages</li>
            <li>add a better overlay to the website to show-off the poem at the end, probably with supporting imagery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As per the feedback I had received, the original idea I had did strike off similarities with the Akinator website, which I also noticed later on, so I will cater to the visual style and add in filler illustrations that I will swap out after every
            questions.

        <h2>Design Strategy</h2>
        <ul id="des">
            <li>Improve of the “jankiness” of the website – The website definitely does need some CSS styling and improved JS scripting, which I will work on to make it smooth for atleast the 1366 x 768 px sizing.</li>
            <li>Styling of the page – Add graphic elements, probably created using Illustrator and Photoshop, maybe introduced SVG animations to make it more web-friendly</li>
            <li>Prompt transitions – Add a timer to set and change the opacity of the speech bubble to add a smooth conversation feel for the user</li>
            <li>Overlay manuscripts – The initial idea of the papyrus manuscript was dropped due to time constraints, so maybe iterate on that</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interaction Strategy</h2>
        <ul id="intr">
            <li>Start with the main interaction of asking the players their prompts</li>
            <li>Display the poem with the supporting images</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article id="is">
        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <ul id="exp">
            <li>Want players to have a holistic Greek scribe interaction</li>
            <li>Enjoy a nice poem</li>
        </ul>
