                <h2>VISUAL LITERACY AND VISUAL THINKING</h2>
                <p>Images play an important role in visual thinking, providing contextual clues to the information being presented on a page. It sometimes does become important to incorporate images into text elements to improve the user’s perception ability
                    towards text.</p>
                <p>Certain practices that can help develop and improve close reading abilities include - looking through images, asking open-ended questions and expanding your knowledge. The ability of visual perception and to read close text is something
                    that is developed over time with constant exercise of those abilities. </p>
                <p>I had the opportunity to review the <a href="http://pierrehermenicolasbuffe.com/en/chapter-1#">Pierre Herme x Nicolas Buffe</a> website and ran through the first chapter of their interactive web story “The Kingdom of the Sun and Moon”.
                    The visuals and story were perfectly in sync with each other, complementing the overall impact of the story. All visual elements are also well detailed, in-theme and allow for a seamless storytelling experience. I would suggest everyone
                    to immerse themselves in the website’s experience.</p>

                <h2>BEST MODAL PRACTICES</h2>
                <p>Modals (or pop-ups) are additional UI elements that sit atop the main elements of the page. On encountering a modal in a page, all other elements fade to black and only a small section of the page comes into focus. Users must interact
                    with the popup before returning to the main page.</p>
                <p>All modals need to contain basic UX-friendly elements such as sized exit buttons, titles to express the purpose of the modal, and buttons to quickly allow the user to exit said modal. It is safe to assume that modals are usually associated
                    with spam or unwanted content due to a number of sites using modals for the reasons mentioned above. Hence it is then necessary to allow an easy exit to users from modals.</p>
                <p>Certain good practices mentioned in the article include correct sizing and positioning of said modal, focus on the modal and most importantly, keeping the modals user-initiated, which gives the user a more welcoming experience to the page.
                    If there is any actions that have to be performed by the user on immediately entering the page, DO NOT use a modal to engage with said user.</p>
                <p>Modals aren’t the best for mobile applications, mainly because of the fact that the small screen doesn’t do the user any favours whilst navigating the page, which leads me to a good example of a modal done right. Chrome pop-ups are arguably
                    one of the best pop-ups that have been created.</p>

                <h2>BEST FORM PRACTICES</h2>
                <p>Filling forms an important part of certain recurring UXs, such as online retail shopping, social media applications, payment completions etc. which involves giving away required information to complete the process started by the user.
                    The article discusses multiple methods to improve user experience while filling forms</p>
                <p>There are quite a few interesting methods discussed in the article, one of the more interesting ones was; while filling out long drawn forms is the sectioning out of the input fields to maintain user retention, whilst ensuring the user
                    fills out the required information. Speaking of required information, either the red star, or the (optional) next to optional fields with the pop-up for requesting required information can be used. The red star/asterisk has always
                    been a long-standing method to indicate required fields in forms. The field length suggestion is not a particularly good practice as there is a chance for the page to lose uniformity with the varying sizes of input fields. The suggestion
                    of radio buttons needs to be reduced to 3 or less (number below which radio buttons are acceptable on the page), mainly because radio buttons consume a large amount of space and this won’t be viable for pages that request a large amount
                    of information from the user.</p>
                <p>Some practices I would like to have as a user filling out forms which would improve my overall experience - the multiple steps form is slowly being integrated into older forms which saves the user from endlessly scrolling through pages
                    of information. On entering wrong information, it is better practice to immediately mention the error to the user, albeit annoying. It would hence be better to research and add appropriate example values to input fields, as it is usually
                    sample fields where users go wrong. The idea of highlighting the first input field and ordering the input fields to support users that frequent the Tab button to switch between fields.</p>
                <p>One form filling experience I somehow enjoy is the Github account creation form. Very few inputs, easy and smooth account creation process and the form has also been designed rather well, with the matrix theme suiting Github’s technical
                    ambience very well.</p>
